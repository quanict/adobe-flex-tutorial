Life Cycle of Flex Application
------------------------------

Although, you can build Flex applications without understanding the life cycle phases of an application, it is good to know the basic mechanism; the order in which things occur. It will help you to configure features such as loading other Flex applications at runtime, and manage the process of loading and unloading class libraries and assets at runtime.

A good understanding of the Flex application life cycle will enable you to build better applications and optimize them because you will know where to optimally run code. For example, if you need to ensure that some code runs during a preloader, you need to know where to place the code for that event.
